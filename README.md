FIT CHALLENGE This Application is built in rails, and is a portfolio project for The Flatiron School Javascript/Rails project. This app allows users to create fitness challenges for themselves. Users can create as many challenges as they want, and set time limits for completing a challenge. Each challenge can have workouts added to the challenge so that the user will be able to keep track of challenge completion.
